The `values.yaml` file in a Helm chart is used to define the default configuration values for your application. It allows you to provide a set of customizable parameters that can be easily modified during the installation or upgrade process. Here's an example of a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Default values for your application
replicaCount: 3
image:
  repository: myapp
  tag: 1.0.0
service:
  name: myapp-service
  port: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
  externalPort: 80
```

In this example, we have defined a few parameters with their default values:

- `replicaCount`: Specifies the number of replicas for the application deployment. By default, it is set to `3`.

- `image`: Defines the Docker image details for the application. It includes the repository name and the image tag. By default, it is set to use the image `myapp` with tag `1.0.0`.

- `service`: Specifies the service details for the application. It includes the service name, port, type, and an optional external port. By default, the service is set to `ClusterIP` type with a port of `8080` and an external port of `80`.

By providing default values in the `values.yaml` file, you can make your chart easily configurable. Users can override these values when installing the chart by using the `--set` or `--values` flags with `helm install` command, or by providing a custom `values.yaml` file.

For example, if a user wants to override the `replicaCount` to `5` during installation, they can use:
```
helm install my-chart --set replicaCount=5
```

The `values.yaml` file allows you to define a wide range of parameters and their default values, making your Helm chart highly customizable and adaptable to different deployment scenarios.
